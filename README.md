# 8-puzzle
This 8-puzzle implementation in NetLogo was made as a final project for a course of Introduction to artificial intelligence at my faculty.  It showcases different algorithms and how they can solve the given problem - a sliding puzzle 3x3 size that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles  in random order with one tile missing. The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.  The documentation explains the problem, as well as the algorithms that are used, while Orange software was used for comparing algorithms on different parameters and reports are shown as graphs. Currently, only the Croatian version of documentation is available.
